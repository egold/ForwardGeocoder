ForwardGeocoder
===============

Two categories that make it possible to do forward geocoding in iOS4

Background
==========

Found two useful articles and a github gists

* https://gist.github.com/1952410
* http://blog.corywiles.com/forward-geocoding-in-ios4-and-ios5
* http://ios-blog.co.uk/articles/tutorials/forward-geocoding-for-location-in-previous-ios5-devices/

However, nobody put it on github or cleaned up misspellings / generalized the
completion block to give back *all* the data, so here you go.
